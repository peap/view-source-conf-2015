The Triumph of Generalism
Lyza Danger Gardner

The web is a generalist's paradise.

Mastery of synthesis leads to being a good generalist.

motivation killers/valleys of despair:
* incomplete mastery
* interrupty distractions
* intersection of hard and boring

extraordinary generalism is its own specialty

generalists do things they don't know how to do, with gusto

Overchoice
* constraints give us focus
* the web has always had constraints, but they're much less obvious now
* we now have different sets of constraints to work with (mobile, desktop, ...)
** starting from the center and working outward (content first, building out)

synthesis, strategy, adaptability
cultivate, practice, and SHARE wisdom
