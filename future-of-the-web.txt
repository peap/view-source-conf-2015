The Future of the Web

David Bryant
- Platform Team, Interim CTO of Mozilla

What Mozilla thinks about:
* The web is the BEST platform
** today, and in the future
* Developers = people who build things
** web makers, browser makers, everyone!
* Continual platform enrichment
** Where are the gaps? Recently, games! Thus, WebGL, emscripting, asm.js.
** push the boundaries about what the web can do

Platform and toolkit interplay

A Pattern: connect, access, unlock, span. (and repeat)
* what happens when new devices come onto the scene

Security, privacy, and control

Richer application architectures
* how can we enable new, better architectures?

People are on the web
* used to say people "browse" the web

New Content
New Hardware
New Opportunity

Connecting Devices and People

First principle at Mozilla: the web is the best platform.
