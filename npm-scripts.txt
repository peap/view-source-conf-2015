Some people moving from Grunt/Gulp to npm scripts.

Build scripts w/Grunt and Gulp can grew very quickly to hundreds of lines.

NPM run scripts add .node_modules/ to the $PATH for you, so your scripts can
reference those dependencies' binaries directly (eg, jshint, eslint).

npm-run-all is a useful tool
* https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all

pre- and post- tasks exist for every script
If a pre- task fails with non-zero exit code, the rest of the process won't continue

Building your own command line tools to use with (or without) NPM scripts is
easy:

* also check out "minimist"

Basic empty project to show some cool stuff:
* https://github.com/thealphanerd/start-here

tasks in parallel: task1 & task2 & task3
tasks in series: task1 && task2 && task3

can't do parallel in windows that way, though...
* use npm-run-all (or something else)
