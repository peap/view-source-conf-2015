Josh Carpenter

live coding: Composite Demo

Mozilla VR team's questions:
* Is the web fast enough to do VR?
* If so, then what?

If we care about the Web, we have to get in on the ground floor with new
technologies, such as VR.

One catch: it's too hard to create WebVR experiences.
* all WebGL so far - not many WebGL devs in the world

A-Frame: building blocks for the VR web
* a-components.js
* open source library for creating web VR experiences w/o WebGL knowledge
* A-Frame is the DOM
* aframe.io
* mozvr.com
* github.com/mozvr
