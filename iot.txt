The Web, Wearables, and IoT: Connecting the Dots
Tom Wesselman

IoT shouldn't focus on just connecting everything... think about the overall
user experience.

It's the result of the technology that's really interesting.

How can we do this? A few options:
* super remote control
* orchestration in the cloud
* peer-to-peer

It's a hard, big job to figure this out.
* need open standards, which take years
* requires cooperation of multiple companies, big and small
* developer community

web apps have evolved to be orchestrations of experiences that are really
exciting

How do we work with IoT devices in web apps?

Option 1: meet in the web; connect devices to web & use web APIs
* give the device an IP address
* use a relay application
* bluetooth 6LoWPAN
* challenges:
** who am i?
** what is "my" house?
** what happens when I sell my house?

Option 2: extend the browser
* relax the sandbox: Chrome, Firefox OS
* expose existing protocols:
** USB HID definitions
** bluetooth and RFCOMM
** bluetooth smart (BLE) profiles
* Proposal for w3c BT API: https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth
