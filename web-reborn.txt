The Web, Reborn
-or-
The web as an app platform. F'reals, this time.

Chris Wilson

The Web Rocks as an app platform:
* low friction
* incredible reach
* discoverability
* user-centric safety model

Except...
* poor reliability, bandwidth-wise
* poor integration w/normal UX; mobile browser was more of window to the web,
rather than a 2-way interaction with the user
* "not very rich"
* "slow"
* hard to create a "relationship" with the user

Native apps are:
* reliable
** even in uncertain bandwidth situations, apps tend to work
* performant
** time to launch from home screen should be < 1s
* engagement

Progressive web app: a low friction, responsive, robust, engaging user
experience built using modern web capabilities, like service work, push
notifications, and web app manifest.

Technologies
* Web App Manifest - immersive UX/Home Screen
* Service Workers
** better than AppCache 
** SW services network requests
** SW services push notifications
** SWs are transient bits of code
** basic offline is easy, rich MVC is possible

Most of the new APIs are HTTPS only, hooray!

Learn developer tools and performance testing.

Brainstorm what you can do with push and device access.
* push notifications
* Bluetooth support
* physical web / beacons
* background sync
