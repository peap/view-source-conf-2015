Why npm scripts?

npm scripts = shell + node + npm + magic

package.json:
{
    "scripts": {
        "test": "..."
    }
}

npm run test

lifecycle hooks are great, too: preinstall, (install), postinstall

npm-run-all is a node module to run many tasks in series/parallel

Tradeoffs:
* NPM scripts provide a simpler mental model than Grunt/Gulp, instead of performance
* less code, but less extensible
* shell scripting is still hard, especially maintaining cross-compatibility with Windows
