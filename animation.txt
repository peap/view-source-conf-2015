Flash may be gone, but the era of web animation has just begun.

Four people this talk is for:

UI designers
* animation guides users through interactions using
** relationships, structure, cause & effect
** offloading interpretation of changes to the perception system can speed up
comprehension and reduce cognitive load

Interaction developers
* make complex interations

Types of animations
* static: start to finish
* stateful: default state -- event --> predefined state
** hover, click, etc.
* dynamic: current state -- event --> new state (determined by certain factors)

Animation library developers
* GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
** most popular animation library for interaction development
* Velocity.js (replaces jQuery's $.animate() function)

Animation History: The Fall of Flash

The Web Animation API
* unified language for CSS and SVG animations

Animation Spec Authors & Implementors

2016 Prediction: Animation tooling will be big.

birtles.github.io/areweanimatedyet

browser support is... coming. for now, there's a polyfill: github.com/web-animations

We need to talk to each other to get stuff done:

UI Designers
* don't be afraid of JS
* take time top lay with the libraries
* adopt tooling quickly

Interaction Developers
* check out the polyfill's page
* give feedback

Animation library developers
* go read the spec
* give feedback

Animation Spec Authors & Implementors
* find better ways of taking feedback
* email and IRC are not enough
* meet your users in the field

2017 Prediction: you might not need GSAP
